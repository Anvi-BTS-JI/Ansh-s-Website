A psychologist is a professional who practices psychology and studies normal and abnormal mental states, perceptual, cognitive, emotional, and social processes and behavior by experimenting with, and observing, interpreting, and recording how individuals relate to one another and to their environments.[1]

Psychologists usually acquire a four-year bachelor's degree with honors in psychology, followed by a master's degree or doctorate in psychology. Unlike psychiatrists, psychologists usually cannot prescribe medication, although in some jurisdictions psychologists do have prescription privileges.
