Cardiology  is a branch of medicine that deals with the disorders of the heart as well as some parts of the circulatory system. Although cardiologist and cardiosurgeons study the same thing, cardiologist typically refer people to a cardiac surgeon when the need arises, because most cardiologists do not perform heart surgeries themselves. ... They may perform more minor surgical procedures like placing stents to keep arteries open. To become a cardiologist or cardiosurgeon you need an MBBS degree but becoming a cardiosurgeon is a bit difficult.
