Neurology, "string, nerve" and the suffix -logia, "study of") is a branch of medicine dealing with disorders of the nervous system. Neurology deals with the diagnosis and treatment of all categories of conditions and disease involving the central and peripheral nervous systems (and their subdivisions, the autonomic and somatic nervous systems), including their coverings, blood vessels, and all effector tissue, such as muscle.A neurologist is a physician specializing in neurology and trained to investigate, or diagnose and treat neurological disorders. Neurologists treat a myriad of neurologic conditions.Neurologists and neurosurgeons both diagnose and manage nervous system disorders, but neurologists do not perform surgery.While a neurosurgeon may conduct surgery to treat medical problems, neurolgiss treat specific conditions with medications and other procedures.
